## features

- sends discord webhook notifications when new quests appear
- docker support
- checks every 30 minutes

## environment variables

- `TOKEN` - discord authentication token (required)
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` - webhook for notifications (required)
- `REWARD_FILTER` - "orbs" or "all" (default: "all")

## usage

### docker (recommended)

```bash
docker run -d \
           --name discord-quest-watcher \
           --restart=unless-stopped \
           -e TOKEN=your-token \
           -e DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your-webhook-url \
           -e REWARD_FILTER=orbs \
           ghcr.io/xhos/discord-quest-watcher:latest
```

### local

```bash
export TOKEN="your_discord_token"
export DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="your_webhook_url"
export REWARD_FILTER="orbs"

go run .
```

## how it works

authenticates with your discord token and navigates to the quests page in headless chromium. scrapes the quest data, compares against previously seen quests, and sends webhook notifications for any new entries. state is tracked in /data/known-quests.json with 30-minute check intervals.
